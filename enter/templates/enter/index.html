    <small><strong>WARNING:  THIS IS A BETA RELEASE OF SEEK.  WHILE DATA AND METHODS SHOULD BE RELIABLE, FORMATTING CHANGES WILL BE HAPPENING.  PLEASE DON’T HESITATE TO <a href="">CONTACT US</a> ABOUT QUESTIONS/CONCERNS/COMMENTS</strong></small>

    SEEK is an open online resource to enable researchers and students to get jump-started in the field of computational enzyme engineering, in addition to being a repository for the worlds largest data sets of kinetic constants from engineered enzymes produced, purified, and kinetically characterized using standardized methods.  We developed robust and simple <methods (link)> to enable researchers and students to rapidly and reliably carry out “design-build-test-learn “ enzyme engineering cycles on a set of standardized enzymes.  By following these standardized protocols we can generate experimentally uniform <data (link)> data sets correlating the sequence-structure-function relationship for these enzymes.  We encourage you to explore the kinetic constants of the engineered enzymes, use the compiled data in your own research, or even follow the standardized methods and engineer your own enzymes to submit data back to SEEK.
