    SEEK is an open online resource to enable researchers and
    students to get jump-started in the field of computational
    enzyme engineering.  In addition, SEEK aims to be a repository
    for the worlds largest data sets of kinetic constants from
    engineered enzymes produced, purified, and kinetically
    characterized using standardized methods. Using the robust and
    simple methods provided in SEEK, researchers and students
    can rapidly and reliably carry out &ldquo;design-build-test-
    learn&rdquo; enzyme engineering cycles on a set of standardized
    enzymes. By using standardized methods we can generate large,
    high quality, data sets correlating changes in sequence and
    structure to measured enzyme kinetic constants.  These data
    sets will further our understanding of the sequence, structure,
    function relationship in enzymes, and can be used for the
    development of computational enzyme engineering tools.

    <br><br>

    We encourage you to explore the kinetic constants of the
    engineered enzymes, use the compiled data in your own research,
    or even follow the methods to engineer your own enzymes and
    submit the resulting data back to SEEK.  Enjoy!
